The project includes a small piece of code, about 50 loc long, from
the bash-completion project (from a _command_offset() function).

This code is used in __qubes_dom0_update_run_dnf_completion() function,
and basically provides arguments shift for completion with another command,
e.g. like sudo does. In our case it is about passing completion to dnf.

Note, that this piece of code does not follow qubes-completion guidelines and
style, shellcheck is also suppressed (disabled) for several places.
Still it was decided to keep it as is to have connection with original code.

bash-completion project also uses GPLv2 or later license, so there is no issue.
But in case this code has to be removed (e.g. due to change of the license), 
it could be:
- rewritten (because it is small), or 
- somehow sourced out to an external file or package (but it would break 
    a single-file installation approach).

Either way, the work of bash-completion authors is very much appreciated.
The list of authors of bash-completion and header of bash_completion file
that was used to get this piece of code is provided below:
